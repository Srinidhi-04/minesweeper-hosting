## ðŸ“– My story
This bot started as a passion project as I attempted to bring minesweeper, a game I had learnt to love, to Discord. After making the first version of the bot which featured a simple command to play 8x8 minesweeper, I started to love the work that went into making a bot. I decided to pursue the project by advancing the development of the bot. Still holding onto the original idea of minesweeper, I took the simple game and broke it down to make it even more exciting. I brought in custom grid sizes, global and server leaderboards, multiplayer game modes, tournaments, and even personal profiles. This bot had transformed from a mere passion project, into something big. It was at this point that I realised that the initial game of minesweeper could not be pursued any furthur and I had to broaden my scope. So, I began introducing new games. Starting with connect 4, I brought in a plethora of games that truly enhanced the bot and helped attract more users. At this point, I noticed how my friends started forming closer bonds by playing these games together, and I was now on a new mission. This bot, which was started just to bring minesweeper to Discord, was now a tool that I would use to help build enriching and lasting relationships between friends. By using fun and interactive board games, I was now going to help friends grow closer through the world of gaming. Contrary to the online gaming experience that our generation is so familiar with, I am now using classic board games to create stronger relationships between people. And that is my plan going forward: to build more fun games for people to enjoy and bond over. As for the name of the bot, you may be wondering why I haven't changed it yet. To me, the name serves as a reminder of what this bot started with. Despite where I am going, I feel that it is always important to remember where it all started from. So that's my story! I hope it interested you, and I hope it inspires you to go forward and reach for the stars!
