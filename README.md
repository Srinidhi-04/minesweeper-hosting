## ðŸ“– My story
This bot started as a passion project as I attempted to bring minesweeper, a game I had learned to love, to Discord. After making the first version of the bot, which featured a simple command to play 8x8 minesweeper, I started to love the work that went into making a bot. I decided to pursue the project by advancing the development of the bot. Still holding onto the original idea of minesweeper, I took the simple game and broke it down to make it even more exciting. I introduced custom grid sizes, global and server leaderboards, multiplayer game modes, tournaments, and personal profiles. This bot had transformed from a mere passion project into something big. At this point, I realized that the initial game of minesweeper could not be pursued further, and I had to broaden my scope. So, I began introducing new games. Starting with connect 4, I brought in many games that genuinely enhanced the bot and helped attract more users. At this point, I noticed how my friends started forming closer bonds by playing these games, and I was now on a new mission. This bot, created to bring minesweeper to Discord, had now transformed into a tool used to help build enriching and lasting relationships between friends. By using fun and interactive board games, I was now going to help friends grow closer through the world of gaming. Contrary to the online gaming experience that our generation is so familiar with, I am now using classic board games to create stronger relationships between people. And that is my plan: to build more fun games for people to enjoy and bond over. As for the bot's name, you may be wondering why I haven't changed it yet. To me, the name reminds me of what this bot started with. Despite where I am going, it is always important to remember where it all started. So that's my story! I hope it interested you and inspires you to go forward and reach for the stars!
